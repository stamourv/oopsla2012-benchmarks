Benchmarks measuring the impact of Performance Report's recommendations

To run:
    make

Output:
    (benchmark orig-avg-time pr-opt-avg-time hand-opt-avg-time
               1 pr-opt-avg-norm-time hand-opt-avg-norm-time)
    ...



orig/
  original, non-optimized versions
pr-opt/
  original versions, modified by following Performance Report's advice
hand-opt/
  versions hand-optmized by experts


Note: The video (codec) and images-entry (ray-tracer) benchmarks do
not have a hand-optimized version. The `pr-opt' and `hand-opt'
versions are identical (the harness script needs both to be present).
